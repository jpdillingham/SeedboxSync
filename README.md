# WhatboxSync
[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/jpdillingham/WhatboxSync.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jpdillingham/WhatboxSync) 

A Java console application for syncing files with a Whatbox.ca account via FTP.  In reality it can be used to do a one-way synchronization (remote to local) for any FTP account, but it was created with Whatbox in mind.
